In order to work, a .env.test file and a .env.development file must be created in the main directory of this repo.
each file must have a value declared as: PGDATABASE
for the .env.test file this value should be 'nc_news_test'
for the .env.development file this value should be 'nc_news'
for example The contents of .env.test would be thus: PGDATABASE = 'nc_news_test'
